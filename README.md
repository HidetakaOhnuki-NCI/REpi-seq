We provide all codes used in the manuscript of "RscEpi-seq".
Most of data analyses were perfomed on NIH High Performace Computer (HPC), Biowulf.
The HPC has 95,000+ core/30+ PB linux cluster.
The scripts are written by Shell script in combination with R or Python.

Outline of the data analyses and data flow in the data analysis is shown in a PDF file "000_Workflow_page1-11.pdf".
