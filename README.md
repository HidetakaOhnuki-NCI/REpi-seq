# Iterative Epigenomic Analyses in the Same Single Cell

We provide all codes used in our paper "Iterative Epigenomic Analyses in the Same Single Cell". Most of data analyses were performed on NIH High-Performace Computer (HPC), Biowulf. The HPC has 95,000+ core/30+ PB Linux cluster. The scripts are written by the Shell script in combination with R.

Outline of the data analyses and data flow in the data analysis is shown in a PDF file "000_Workflow_page1-11.pdf". The Workflows also contains an outline of each Shell script.

Each folder contains a Shell script used in the generation of Figures indicated as the name of the folder. Some of the folders contain supplemental files to run the Shell script.
